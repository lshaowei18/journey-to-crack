Years ago, while I was struggling to cope with procrastination, anxiety and a bunch of other issues, I came across a reddit thread and found this [Russian song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atIwagMBDi4).

Willing to do anything but putting in the work, I clicked into the link. Luckily there were english subtitles. 

The song started with a narrative that I deeply resonated with back then: `The most important thing is to believe and it will succeed`. The narrator in the song started to draw while believing that on his first try, he will be able to draw a beautiful piece of art that he would deem as a success.

He didn't like the result of his first attempt at all; and here comes the issue with that statement. `What happens if you believed, and it is not a success?` People mostly fall into two camps: 

1) They suspect that they need to believe in it even more, have more faith.
2) Since its not a success, then its not meant to be; the person do not have the required talent. 

Number one is a good idea at the start, but we will get high amount of signals that our attempts are not successful as we continue trying, especially if the domain is challenging and complex. I suspect it is a matter of time before the doubts erode the belief and faith. 

### The common world

Number 2 is a scary realisation. In a world where we place so much faith in innate talent, it is painful and hard to accept that we are not as "talented" as we think.

In retrospect, my struggles with procrastination was because I couldn't face signals telling me that I have no talent. When I don't do the work, there is no failure. I would rather be the person who wasted his potential than being someone with no talent.

In the last part of the song, the narrator accepts that beliefs and dreams will not help him, and that its only for the people with talent. Slowly, the narrator accepts the common world, plucking his courage to try again and again. After hundreds of hours of trying, investing his time into skills, he finally was able to create something that he was proud of. 

### Fruits of our labor
The song ended with a positive note; that by embracing the common world and accepting that we dont have talent, that we need to work really hard, we will eventually succeed.

Perhaps I'm too pessimistic, but on bad days I find myself questioning if that is true. There is this quote by Krishna, from the Bhagavad Gita:

> You have the right to work, but for the work's sake only. You have no right to the fruits of work. Desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working.

Its an ongoing journey to understand what the quote is about, and sometimes its really hard to not let the fruits of the work be the motive in working. 

I think I'm in a better place now, and I will always be grateful of this russian song that open my eyes to the common world.
