One of the reasons why I decided to focused on honing my skills as an engineer was because of Naval's [blogpost](https://nav.al/build-sell). 

I thought it made sense, building requires too much focused time for a sales person to pick up later in life and its easier for a builder to pick up selling as long as the builder can figure out their style. 

### A nagging feeling that something was amiss
As I gained more experience, I started to realised that there is a gap. Selling and building sounds straightforward; listen to what the market wants and build it. This assumes:

1) What is being sold is what the customer wants
2) What is sold is what is built
3) User does not face any bugs or flaws

I believe it is really hard to get these three right, at least not the first iteration.

### The need for something in between selling and building
After a customer buys something, there is actually alot of work that needs to be done. 

Are they using the product? Are they happy with it? Is it addressing their [jobs to be done](https://jobs-to-be-done.com/jobs-to-be-done-a-framework-for-customer-needs-c883cbf61c90)?

Posthog understands this by getting their [engineers to do support](https://posthog.com/newsletter/engineers-do-support). 

### Faster feedback loops
I'm a huge fan of the [OODA loop framework](https://powerseductionandwar.com/ooda-and-you/). I believe that doing support/sales improves the orientation of a builder, giving them observations that they otherwise wouldn't be able to see.

I'm left with more questions now; are there other functions or job scopes that we can add to this?
